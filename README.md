I'm a young poet, and with all this emergers
It's definite I wont match up to the influence
These rappers reach out to, plus I'm a lazy dude
so all the grinding don't fit my persona
so before it started I've declare my rapping career over
Psych, This is the second place I feel at home
apart from under my covers, so its rap, my girl
then rap plus more rap, till my ears hurt
exchange the headset pair and if I feel in check
I grab my pen and start venting to who won't dare to reject
nor object but will listen to all I have to say
